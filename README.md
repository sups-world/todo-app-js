# todo-app-js

# Introduction 
This is an app that functions as a task manager.It uses the general concept of a to-do list. The user can input the tasks they want to do and it'll be displayed as a list. Since this uses local storage, the list won't get deleted even after the browser is closed. So the list remains until browser's memory is cleared.

# Technologies Used
This app has been built with HTML,CSS and vanillaJS.
